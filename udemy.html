              <h1 class="bodytextfilm">Native Strength is a centuries-old inter-tribal traditional mental health care system.  It uses medicine wheels, teaching triangles, and traditional stories to illustrate concepts and provide useful tools for personal insight and coping strategies.</h1>

              <h1 class="bodytextfilm">After experiencing a successful traditional ceremony to have a baby, Hyapatia began studying with two medicine men, a medicine woman (Gladys Tantaquideon, brother to the last chief of the Mohicans), and a Hawaiian Kahuna. These teachers shared traditional wisdom from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, Hawaiian, and many other cultures. This collection became known as Native Strength as it awakens the strength that is inside each of us. Medicine wheels help us to remember and comprehend this complicated system.</h1>

      <p class="bodytextfilm"><span class="boldtypeTan">Native American Mental Health Care - </span> The Native Strength path is a centuries-old philosophy that uses medicine wheels to make sense of our world. Native American religion and culture were illegal in the United States until 1978. These teachings were part of that culture. You'll be introduced to the inner personas and the fear-feeders along with ways to help differentiate between the two.  When we learn how to listen to our inner elders and children more, the fear-feeders can't be heard. Our apprehension often holds us back from fulfilling our dreams. It's easy to imagine all of the things that can go wrong and talk ourselves out of just about anything. Once we recognize these voices of fear, they begin to develop sly ways of sneaking their toxic messages into our inner dialogue. It takes some practice to weed them out at this point and that's what this course can do for you.  We will examine the medicine wheel of fear-feeder voices that shows us the manipulative and creative ways they try to stop us from finding success and happiness. This course will help you to hear the voices of your inner elders clearer, filling you full of self-esteem and the inspiration you need to find success.

        Learn how to help yourself and others with these traditional techniques.

      <p class="bodytextfilm"><span class="boldtypeTan">The Native American Guide to Handling Toxic People - </span> This course examines over thirty different kinds of people and situations that steal our time and energy. There are ways to handle this without getting sucked into the drama and desires of others. When we examine these people using the Wheel of Life, we can find the best ways to counteract their behavior and save our energy and time. There are thirty-five different types of people and situations discussed in this course. There are four kinds of the following toxic people discussed in this course: the sly and deviant, our rulers, persecutors, those who infuriate us, the violent bullies, ones who shame us, pesky and annoying people, and the most difficult of all, our inner bullies.

        The voices in our heads sometimes treat us worse than anyone else. The voices that feed on our fears, our fear feeders, hold us back from living our life to our fullest potential. They survive on our fears and when we learn how to silence them, we find ourselves with much less stress and anger.
        
        This course helps us to manage situations beyond our control that cause us stress, like a pandemic, environmental disasters beyond our control, and the age-old problems of not enough time or space.
        
        This information comes from the centuries-old indigenous American people of North and Central America. It has been passed on through generations due to its accuracy and eternal relevance.
        
        Handling toxic people and situations isnâ€™t about being stronger, itâ€™s about being smarter.

      <p class="bodytextfilm"><span class="boldtypeTan">Ayahuasca and other Native American Teaching Plants - </span> People have used many types of hallucinogenic, or teaching plants, for thousands of years. There has recently been a lot of interest in such plants. Many people are stressed, depressed, anxious, lost, and separated from the Creator. They're looking for a solution to their problems, a way to tap into a vast resource of knowledge and love they know is waiting for them. Teaching plants can hold the answer for some.

        I was taught the traditional ways to respectfully use such plants by the elders of my tribe. In this course, I share the 13 steps one may experience with a strong teaching plant. You may be surprised to find that the first few steps are often done on your own.  We'll also talk about the 11 steps on the Red Human Road, a path that can be traveled without the help of teaching plants, and how the first few steps on both paths are similar. You'll learn about the assemblage point and why some people are depressed and suicidal.  When my culture looks at such conditions, they are not simply a diagnosis, they show a clear path out of such despair. Teaching plants can offer one such path.
        
        These steps are not done at once.  Often it will take a lifetime to traverse them all, or even several lifetimes.  Every step awakens a deeper part of us and we may find ourselves at peace and more enlightened if we understand the steps, approach them with no fear, and are open to the experience.
        
        Plants such as ayahuasca, peyote, and magic mushrooms should always be used cautiously and with respect.  It's wise to be prepared and that's why I've offered this course. However, a guide is still recommended when using these plants. Many tourists who travel to other countries in search of an ayahuasca experience may find tribal elders are reluctant to accompany them on their experience.  This is because so many people have used the opportunity simply to get high.  This can be very disheartening for those of us who see teaching plants as sacred gifts.

        <p class="bodytextfilm"><span class="boldtypeTan">The Native American Warrior's Walk - Empowerment motivation - </span> This course uses traditional Native American teachings that will show you how to stand up for yourself. Youâ€™ll be able to recognize when you are being manipulated by others and put a stop to it gracefully. <br>

          Take Control Of Your Life In The Traditional Native American Way <br>
          
          Â· Understand the Circle of Foxes <br>
          
          Â· Begin the Dance of the Coyotes <br>
          
          Â· Rewrite the Story of Your Life <br>
          
          Â· Discover your choices with the wheel of Attitudes & Approaches <br>
          
          Â· Gain a deeper understanding of all medicine wheels with the Wheel of Life <br>
          
          Live the life you planned before you were born without shame.<br>
          
          Native American tradition says we planned our life before we were born. This is our Sacred Dream or our Childrenâ€™s Fire. Denying this dream goes against The Creator. Armed with the tools in this course, youâ€™ll be able to confidently walk your path undeterred by toxic people and make yourself a priority.
          
          The Circle of Foxes medicine wheel shows us what it looks like to live our life for the approval of others in all eight directions. The Dance of the Coyote shows us the opposite. The Story of Your Life shows you exactly how you are in control. The Wheel of Attitudes and Approaches introduces us to solutions we may never have considered. The Wheel of Life is the key to all medicine wheels and shows us exactly what each direction stands for to gain a deeper understanding.
          
          Youâ€™ll learn to recognize people who are highly influenced by the opinions of others and why this can be problematic. Many of us donâ€™t even realize how others have impacted our behavior until we see on the medicine wheel. Living our life for others can be disguised as independence.
          
          Having control over our inner dialog is the first step and youâ€™ll learn how to recognize words that simply feed on your fears and silence them.
          
          When we know what we truly want out of life, our Sacred Dream, our spirit is re-energized and our life has purpose.
